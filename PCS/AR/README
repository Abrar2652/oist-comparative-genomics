Dataset: These Lunter_IGS plots were reproduced using "/bucket/.mabuya/MillerU/Zifcakova/genome_coordinates2/Lunter/Lunter.bed" file.
Script: "/bucket/.mabuya/MillerU/Abrar/PCS/AR/AR_plots.py"

Lunter et al.'s Fig-1B seems to have a maximum sequence length of 500, so I explicitly tried to reproduce Luner_IGS_500.

Conclusion: These figures don't resemble each other. So, the IGS I'm using is not what Lunter et al. used to plot their figures.

I created these plots out-of-curiosity to observe how the length distribution of these AR sequences look without implementing any 
PCS computations on them. 


** Inside indel_terminated, mismatch_terminated, both_mismatch_indel_terminated folders, you'll find "AR_both_lowercase_match" folder

The files inside this directory were created under certain following conditions:

      1. Both human repetitive (AR or lowercase) sequences and genome2 lowercase sequences were compared
      2. Terminated on indels, mismatches, indel+mismatch for both alignments
      3. By definition, terminated on uppercases because we are dealing with ancestral repeats (lowercases) 
      
** Inside indel_terminated, mismatch_terminated, both_mismatch_indel_terminated folders, you'll find "AR_only_hg_lowercase_match" folder

The files inside this directory were created under certain following conditions:

      1. Only human repetitive (AR or lowercase) sequences were analyszed, and genome2 lowercase sequences were ignored
      2. Terminated on indels, mismatches, indel+mismatch for only hg alignments 
      3. By definition, terminated on uppercases because we are dealing with ancestral repeats (lowercases) 
      
      
##  Trials for LPH Fig1B ###
***Both human and species2 lowercase comparison:***

file: "/bucket/.mabuya/MillerU/Abrar/PCS/AR/indel_terminated/AR_both_lowercase_match/"

LPH didn't adopt this method. In this method:
repetitive/lowercase sequences for both hg19 and mm10 were compared
terminated on indels and uppercases
analogous to the indel-terminated vanilla sequence computations except that here I only dealt with the lowercases instead of uppercases
str1 = 'ATCGCTCGGGGG--ACCCC-a--atcgtccctacc-AAATTA-atct-atctac-cct--aa'
str2 = 'ATCGTGAGGCA----ACGGA--ACA-CAAACCCA-AC-ACCCA-ctatc-ggga-tacg-tc'

output:
tct 
a 
ctac 
cct 
aa


***Only human indel-terminated repetitive sequences/AR/lowercases:***

file: "/bucket/.mabuya/MillerU/Abrar/PCS/AR/indel_terminated/AR_only_hg_lowercase_match_LPH/"

LPH adopted this method, although I wonder why mm10 sequences are needed because mm10 is not used in this computation.
repetitive/lowercase sequences for only hg19 were analyzed 
terminated on indels and uppercases in hg19 
no termination for mm10 sequences until indel encountered
str1 = 'ATCGCTCGGGGG--ACCCC-a--atcgtccctacc-AAATTA-atct-atctac-cct--aa'
str2 = 'ATCGTGAGGCA----ACGGA--ACA-CAAACCCA-AC-ACCCA-ctatc-ggga-tacg-tc'

output:

tct 
a 
ctac

aa


***Only human indel-terminated repetitive sequences/AR/lowercases: (I didn't try this one yet)***

file: "/bucket/.mabuya/MillerU/Abrar/PCS/AR/indel_terminated/AR_only_hg_lowercase_ignore_mm10/"

Another variation could be possible, and it also might be similar to LPH Fig1B. But I don't know if this is the the right thing to do as I'm completely ignoring mm10. 

str1 = 'ATCGCTCGGGGG--ACCCC-a--atcgtccctacc-AAATTA-atct-atctac-cct--aa'

output:
a
atcgtccctacc
atct
atctac
cct
aa
